## Overview 

Metagenomics is an emerging technique to explore the composition of complex microbial communities, find species or genes of interest in samples with high diversity. This course covers multiple different approaches in metagenomics and covers the bioinformatics analysis part of those.

### Learning Objectives

- Questions you can ask and answers you may expect when using metagenomics approaches
- Understand the fundamentals, advantages, disadvantages and potential biases of different approaches
- Be aware of the requirements (knowledge, time, money, hardware) of different approaches
- Learn about different bioinformatics pipelines in metagenimics data analysis
:::


### Target Audience

This course was designed for researchers, healthcare and public health professionals with extensive wet-lab  but limited bioinformatics experience.


### Prerequisites

The course builds up the knowledge gradually, making it suitable for everyone even without much previous knowledge. However, even if the course includes a short recap session, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of next-generation sequencing techniques, Unix / Linux comman line usage and R / RStudio usage.

### Exercises

Exercises in these materials are labelled according to their level of difficulty:

| Level | Description |
| ----: | :---------- |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} | Exercises in level 1 are simpler and designed to get you familiar with the concepts and syntax covered in the course. |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} | Exercises in level 2 combine different concepts together and apply it to a given task. |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} | Exercises in level 3 require going beyond the concepts and syntax introduced to solve new problems. |
